*Gaselnita* binaries
--------------------

**Gaselnita**

A simple mobile application (only available for *Android* for now) meant to ease spotting people in a crowded place.<br>
The principle is alternating a series of (predefined) colors on the phone screen, that can be visible by anyone searching for the user.<br>
It's like a visual location sharing system.

**This is just a temporary hosting location** (to still be available online), until pubishing it to [Google Play](https://play.google.com/store/apps). Unfortunately the publishing process is painful (which is good as applications are thoroughly verified) and might take some time.

**Platforms**:
- *Android*
