*LLVMLite 0.35.0* binaries
--------------------------

- Original *.whl*s downloaded from [[PyPI]: llvmlite 0.35.0 - Download files](https://pypi.org/project/llvmlite/0.35.0/#files)
- Adapted *Python 3.**8*** versions for *v3.**9***

- **Tests fail**

    ```
    ----------------------------------------------------------------------
    Ran 299 tests in 2.711s

    FAILED (errors=4, skipped=3)
    ```

    but I don't know how relevant that is, because same thing happens with official *.whls* for *Python 3.8* (although something is definitely wrong here)

**Platforms**:
- *Windows*
